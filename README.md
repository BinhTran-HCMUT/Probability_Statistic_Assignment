# Probability and Statistic Assignment
_This is the assignment of Probability and Statistic using R language. It contains two activities, but I will describe only first activity which I do. Further description of second activity (done by my team member) is available in my report._
## Activity 1: Using Linear Regression to predict house price at King County in Washington
